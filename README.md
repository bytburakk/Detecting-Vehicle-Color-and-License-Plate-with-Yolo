Detecting License Plate and Color of Vehicles With to Yolo

V1.0 -- The project is currently made with only 100 photos and 100 epochs, so there may be minor errors.

🚀 Used Libraries
Cv2, Numpy, Ultralytics, Pytesseract and PIL were used in the project.

Acknowledgments 💡
OpenCV: Image processing, object detection and text insertion.
YOLO: Object detection (especially vehicles and license plates).
Tesseract OCR: Recognizing text on license plates.
Pillow (PIL): Image processing and OCR compatibility.
NumPy: Image data and numerical calculations.

Future Enhancements ✨
Adding Other Country License Plates for License Plate Recognition.
Development of Color Recognition System.
Addition of Detection on Video.
